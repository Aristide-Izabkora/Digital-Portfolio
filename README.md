**Evidence** 
 
*Situation:*
- I had to present an idea to my leaders on what type of website or application I want to create. I brought it to them, and they were satisfied with my idea. The idea was a nail tech website where people could book a nail tech at their closest mall.

*Task:*
- I had to create a UI/UX design for the website (Created logo, colors used in the website, and typography).
- Start creating the website or application based on your choice of coding language.
- I had to present it at the end.

*Action:*
- I used Figma to create the design of the website.
- I used Typescript, HTML, CSS, Vite, and Node.js.
- I created a video 

*Result:*
- Figma

 When creating any designs, I always use Figma because I am more familiar with it.
